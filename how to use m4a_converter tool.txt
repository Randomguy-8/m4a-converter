This is a simple bash script that i use to convert .m4a file to .mp4
it uses ffmpeg to complete its process.

###HOW TO uses___________________________________________________________
To execute this bash script U need to follow these introductions:

Go to m4a_converter's file-properties and give it all executeable
permisions or just open terminal in the directory where m4a_converter
tool is present and type the following command "chmod +x m4a_converter".
After giving executeable permissions follow this next step

now you need to execute m4a_converter file. You can do it by following
